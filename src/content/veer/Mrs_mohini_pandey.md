shortDescription: "Mrs. mohini pandey is the mother of Martyr  Capt Manoj Pandey, who sacrificed his life in service of the nation."
fullDescription: "When the fall of 1998 witnessed heart-wrenching bloodshed in Jammu & Kashmir, hopes and dreams of several families were shattered. Spending sleepless nights, Mohini Pandey, mother of Late Capt Manoj Pandey, still held unflinching hope that her son would return to celebrate his birthday on March 6, 1999.Providing the family with emotional support, she drew courage from the several letters she exchanged with her son—something she still does, 20 years after his death.“I am proud of him. When we received the news of his death, I lost my sense of being for some time. But, for the sake of my other three children, I pulled myself together. Usually, it is a parent’s duty to enlighten the moral path for their children, but here, it was the other way round where Manoj not only turned out to be a good son but also a responsible brother with the example he set,” says Mohini. Now, she hopes to see her granddaughter in uniform soon."
