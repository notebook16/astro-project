fullDescription: "On many evenings, Deepa Sharma looks back at the time when the Kargil war broke out. Despite being on leave, her son had insisted on going for duty. She had two options: to either hold him back or to encourage him to fight for his motherland. She chose the latter, knowing that this could be her last conversation with Maj Ritesh Sharma.Twenty years later, her tears have not dried but she is proud of her decision. Maj Sharma was killed in action in the Kargil war but not before fighting till his last breath.A woman is the powerhouse of strength for the family. She cannot afford to break down, no matter what the loss is,she says. With no other children, Deepa and her husband see Ritesh in other children around them. Active in social service, they leave no stone unturned in making lives of others better."
