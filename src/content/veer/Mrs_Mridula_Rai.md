fullDescription: "Immediately after her son was killed in action, Mridula Rai found a certain sense of relief in her teaching job which she joined soon after the incident. “I see my son in every child,” she says, referring to Navneet, who was martyred during Operation Rakshak in 2001 in a counter-insurgency operation in Jammu & Kashmir.She often sits back to admire her house which was Navneet’s creation.“This house was his dream, but one terrorist can shatter an entire house,” she says. While her son made the most supreme sacrifice for his motherland, it turned to be his mother’s most painful too.However, the retired teacher sought solace in teaching the same values to her students that she taught her son. “It was because of my discipline that Navneet eased into the Army life so well,” she says with pride."
